                    assumptions through user research and testing. Thus we can focused our effort on delivering the best

                    <p>Rayo listeners need a way to find catchup shows, so that they can listen to their favourite
                        shows that they missed.</p>

                        listening habits. Design the UX/UI of the new journey.</p>

                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>Product wanted to introduce a station brand page with an aim to please our loyal radio listeners with
                    content promotions, music suggestions, and potentially cross pollinate to other stations with
                    similar genres of music. As a feature parity, we will also add a schedule page for each station
                    because we have it on our web platform.</p>

                <h3>Improving the radio page</h3>
                <p>Radio page is the starting point of the journey, we took this opportunity to improve the experience
                    of the current radio page. We explore many directions, and have selected 3 options for user testing,
                    from the MVP to the most complex version.</p>

                <h3>Station brand page stimulus</h3>
                <p>Product's hypothesis suggests that a station page can make users feel more connected to the brands
                    they recognise and love. They would like to see when their favourite presenters are on-air.
                    On the hand, this page is also a good way to help new users make an informed decision when picking a
                    station.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Identify the core value</h3>
                <p>Based on user testing, majority found the brand page layout too busy, and saw it as advertisment
                    rather than personalised content discovery.</p>
                <p>Many liked the page with bigger thumbnails, but there were confusions about whether the stations
                    are on-demand shows or live stations.</p>
                <p>The schedule page met their expactations, and was very well received. Based on our playback
                    data and user research, our users tend to find catchup shows from the schedule. This is because they
                    register radio show as episodic content, instead they regonise radio show with dates.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Pivot</h3>
                <p>The feedback we received clearly shows that a station page isn't what our users are looking for, and
                    it's not worth the effort required to built this page. We synthesised the data and present back to
                    Product, then try to aligned with Product with the new direction we proposed.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Focus on delivering value</h3>
                <p>We concluded that if we want to keep pursuing the concept of a station page, it would require further
                    research, and more thougths on what value we can provide. The epic has transformed from station page
                    epic into schedule page epic, and we would focus our effort on developing the schedule page.</p>

                <h3>Final iterations</h3>
                <p>Since checking the schedule and finding catchup show is one of the main goal of our users, a schedule
                    button was added to the For you page (homepage) as a secondary button. We also moved the schedule
                    button to a more prominent position for easy access on the radio page. The user can also access the
                    schedule on the maxi-player when listening to a live station.</p>
                <p>Using the selected station name as the page title is a challenge for the devs, and is not recommeded
                    by iOS's navigation guidelines. Thus we moved it to underneath the station disc. Schedule vary based
                    on the selected local split, to clarify which split of the station schedule is on screen, we added
                    the local split name in bracket, with a marquee animation if the name exceeded the screen width. We
                    also changed the edit button from an icon button to a text button for better affordance.</p>
                <p>We introduce a rectangular progress bar around the thumbnail image, and added an on-air tag next to
                    the section title. They were introduced to distictly indicate the follow are live radio stations,
                    not on-demand radio show.</p>
