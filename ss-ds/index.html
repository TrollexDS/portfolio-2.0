                            class="tooltip">Open link</span></a> is a B2B OTT service provider. We design and build apps
                    across all platforms including mobile, tablet, web, TV for clients across the globe. As a small team
                    of 2, we need a relable way to efficiently switch between different clients' brandings and generate
                    designs needed for production or sales proposals.</p>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>We leveraged a third-party Figma plugin to save colors, fonts, and images as reusable themes,
                        aimed to enable quick replacement of selected designs with pre-saved assets. However, due to the
                        large number of screens in our projects, the plugin often took several minutes to process. This
                        frequently caused Figma to freeze or glitch, leading to errors that required time-consuming
                        manual checks and fixes.

                <div class="project-intro overview">
                    <h4>Goal</h4>
                    <p>Refactored our design system to adopt Figma’s newly introduced native “Swap Library” feature.
                        This improved reliability, eliminated glitches and errors caused by the plugin, and reduced the
                        time needed to switch between brand themes to just a few seconds.</p>

                <h3>Design system refractor</h3>
                <p>In order to adopt the Figma swap library feature, I defined a new sructure and rename every token or
                    layers of the following:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Colour tokens</h3>
                <p>Our colour token template contains a wide range of component-specific color tokens, giving our
                    clients greater flexibility to
                    customize the look and feel of their apps.</p>
                <p>In order for these tokens to be compatible with the Figma swap library feature, I defined a new
                    sructure and rename every token.</p>

                <h3>Imagery</h3>
                <p>We also created a template for the 16:9 video thumbnails used throughout the app. We would replace
                    these placeholder images with content sourced from clients’ websites, sometimes for production-ready
                    designs, other times for sales proposals.</p>

                <h3>Typeface</h3>
                <p>Font styles are fixed in size and weight to ensure text remains visible and the app stays accessible.
                    However, we give clients the flexibility to choose a single typeface to be used consistently across
                    all their apps.</p>

                <h3>Swap library</h3>
                <p>Every time we onboard a new client, we duplicate our templates and set up a custom theme. By swapping the design library, we can instantly apply the client’s unique look and feel. This approach has allowed my team of 2 designers to efficiently manage and deliver a large library of client designs with ease.</p>
