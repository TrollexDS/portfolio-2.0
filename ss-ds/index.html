                            class="tooltip">Open link</span></a> is a B2B OTT service provider. We design and build apps
                    across all platforms including mobile, tablet, web, TV for clients across the globe. As a small team
                    of 2, we need a relable way to efficiently switch between different clients' brandings and generate
                    designs needed for production or sales proposals.</p>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>We leveraged a third-party Figma plugin to save colors, fonts, and images as reusable themes,
                        aimed to enable quick replacement of selected designs with pre-saved assets. However, due to the
                        large number of screens in our projects, the plugin often took several minutes to process. This
                        frequently caused Figma to freeze or glitch, leading to errors that required time-consuming
                        manual checks and fixes.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-intro overview">
                    <h4>Goal</h4>
                    <p>Refactored our design system to adopt Figma’s newly introduced native “Swap Library” feature.
                        This improved reliability, eliminated glitches and errors caused by the plugin, and reduced the
                        time needed to switch between brand themes to just a few seconds.</p>

                <p>We defined various sizes for spacing and radius to improve design consistancy. In addition, I also
                    introduced breakpoints as variables to automate component swapping between different screen sizes.

                <h3>Components refractor</h3>
                <p>Collection card is one of the few components that needed to be refractored. There were a total of 48
                    variants for this one component, each showed the exact information, just with a different background
                    or different padding optimised for tablet screen sizes.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <p>Instead of using background configurations as the component variants, I created a separate background
                    component hosting all the different positions and colours. Then it can be used in the collection
                    card
                    component as nested varients, which became a dropdown option from the panel tha can be easier
                    changed, and therefore reduce the duplicated component variants.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <p>The number of variants has been reduced from 48 to 4, and still provide the same level of
                    configurations with all available colour and positions. This also benefited multiple components that
                    required the same level of background configurations, and have their number of variants reduced.</p>

                <h3>One for all</h3>
                <p>As part of the design system optimisation, we auto-layout whenver we can. Since most of the
                    components is exactly the same for both mobile and tablet, only with a different width. Auto layout
                    done correctly means we can use the same variant for both mobile and tablet, by changeing the width
                    on the UI designs.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Layout</h3>
                <p>The current page structure and layout cannot no longer cope with the rapid growing design system.
                    There were too many components in one page, and the logic of component groups were ambiguous. Often
                    times we have to go through a few pages to local the component.</p>
                <p>I want to design a new layout so intuiative that even designers who doesn't have much experience
                    with Figma, or new designers who just join the team to feel comfortable using it.</p>
                <p>Instead of grouping components by ambiguous categories, I separate each component to have it's own
                    page. Each page contains a title section, a component section, and an example section. The purpose
                    of the example section is to showcase any hidden nested variants within the component, and to enable
                    designers to copy and paste production ready instance directly into the production file.</p>

                    a component. Stay tuned for more</p>
