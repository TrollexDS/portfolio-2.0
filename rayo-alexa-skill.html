                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As the first designer to ever join the Voice Connected Device (VCD) team, where the product had
                    previously been developed solely by product managers and engineers without dedicated design support.
                    I was brought in to establish a design foundation and integrate a structured design process into the
                    existing workflow.</p>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>All user journeys were undocumented, existing features are not intuiative. All designs for screen
                        devices needed to be updated with the New Rayo branding (previously Planet Radio).</p>

                    <p>Introduce a design process in the existing workflow. Document and improve all existing journeys,
                        design new assets and UI for screen devices.</p>

                <p>This is the first time I got hands on Alexa devices, an Echo Dot (without screen), and an Echo Show
                    (with screen). I documented every step starting from unboxing
                    the devices all the way to finishing my account set up.</p>
                <p>I wanted to document how far a first time user would interact with the device, and how much context
                    can Alexa understand from me naturally speaking to it. Without given any information from the team,
                    I tried different utterance to ask for different pieces of content.</p>

                <h3>Disappointing AI assistant</h3>
                <p>After testing the devices, it is clear to me that Rayo skill (or any other custom skill) were built
                    with a binary approach, similar to a customer service chatbot. You have follow the exact command
                    structure in order for Alexa to understand and perform the action.</p>

                <ol>"Open [skill name]]" then follow instructions to find what you need.</ol>
                <ol>"Ask [skill name] to [perform an action]".</ol>

                    and logged all synonmys that could be used to ask for specfic shows.</p>

                <p>We concluded that if we want to keep pursuing the concept of a station page, it would require further
                    research, and more thougths on what value we can provide. The epic has transformed from station page
                    epic into schedule page epic, and we would focus our effort on developing the schedule page.</p>

                <h3>Final iterations</h3>
                <p>Since checking the schedule and finding catchup show is one of the main goal of our users, a schedule
                    button was added to the For you page (homepage) as a secondary button. We also moved the schedule
                    button to a more prominent position for easy access on the radio page. The user can also access the
                    schedule on the maxi-player when listening to a live station.</p>
                <p>Using the selected station name as the page title is a challenge for the devs, and is not recommeded
                    by iOS's navigation guidelines. Thus we moved it to underneath the station disc. Schedule vary based
                    on the selected local split, to clarify which split of the station schedule is on screen, we added
                    the local split name in bracket, with a marquee animation if the name exceeded the screen width. We
                    also changed the edit button from an icon button to a text button for better affordance.</p>
                <p>We introduce a rectangular progress bar around the thumbnail image, and added an on-air tag next to
                    the section title. They were introduced to distictly indicate the follow are live radio stations,
                    not on-demand radio show.</p>
