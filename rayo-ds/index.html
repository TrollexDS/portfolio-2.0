                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The Rayo app is growing rapidly, so does the number of design components. Designers often got
                    lost and overwhelmed in the design system file with so many components in each page.
                    I proposed a design system restructure and developed a new organisation system to help my team
                    navigate through the design system file.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid project">
                <div class="project-intro overview">
                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p> Nested instances often got overlooked when hidden from master component, resulted in many
                        duplicated components. A dated colour token system not only required manual work switching
                        between light and dark mode, but also created a lot of unnecessary vairiants, which led to human
                        errors in production design.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-intro overview">
                    <h4>Goal</h4>
                    <p>Adopt variable system to manage colour tokens and automate light and dark mode. Reduce the number
                        of variants with nested components. Design a scalable intuiative structure to organise design
                        components. Indroduce dev mode into our workflow to improve developer handoff.

                <p>Following the <a

                        Figma variable guidelines <span class="tooltip">Open link</span></a>, I worked with another
                    designer to build primatives variables using colours from our brand style guide, then define our
                    tokens in both light and dark mode.</p>

                <h3>Responsive and spacing</h3>
                <p>We defined various sizes for spacing and radius to improve design consistancy. In addition, I also
                    introduced breakpoints as variables to automate component swapping between different screen sizes.

                <h3>Components refractor</h3>
                <p>Collection card is one of the few components that needed to be refractored. There were a total of 48
                    variants for this one component, each showed the exact information, just with a different background
                    or different padding optimised for tablet screen sizes.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="case-study">
                <p>Instead of using background configurations as the component variants, I created a separate background
                    component hosting all the different positions and colours. Then it can be used in the collection
                    card component as nested varients, which became a dropdown option from the panel tha can be easier
                    changed, and therefore reduce the duplicated component variants.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="case-study">
                <p>The number of variants has been reduced from 48 to 4, and still provide the same level of
                    configurations with all available colour and positions. This also benefited multiple components that
                    required the same level of background configurations, and have their number of variants reduced.</p>

                <h3>One for all</h3>
                <p>As part of the design system optimisation, we auto-layout whenver we can. Since most of the
                    components is exactly the same for both mobile and tablet, only with a different width. Auto layout
                    done correctly means we can use the same variant for both mobile and tablet, by changeing the width
                    on the UI designs.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Layout</h3>
                <p>The current page structure and layout cannot no longer cope with the rapid growing design system.
                    There were too many components in one page, and the logic of component groups were ambiguous. Often
                    times we have to go through a few pages to local the component.</p>
                <p>I want to design a new layout so intuiative that even designers who doesn't have much experience
                    with Figma, or new designers who just join the team to feel comfortable using it.</p>
                <p>Instead of grouping components by ambiguous categories, I separate each component to have it's own
                    page. Each page contains a title section, a component section, and an example section. The purpose
                    of the example section is to showcase any hidden nested variants within the component, and to enable
                    designers to copy and paste production ready instance directly into the production file.</p>

                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <p>Every one has a different way of describing things, some called it a carousel, a rail, a playlist...
                    Same elements are named differently in Figma, in iOS, in Android, and it causes miscommunication
                    between teams. We are currently auditing feature/component names, and align with other teams on
                    naming convension. Stay tuned for more</p>
