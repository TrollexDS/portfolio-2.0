                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As the first designer to ever join the Voice Connected Device (VCD) team, where the product had
                    previously been developed solely by product managers and engineers without dedicated design support.
                    I was brought in to establish a design foundation and integrate a structured design process into the
                    existing workflow.</p>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>All user journeys were undocumented, existing features are not intuiative. All designs for screen
                        devices needed to be updated with the New Rayo branding (previously Planet Radio).</p>

                        design new assets and UI for screen devices.</p>

                <h3>Mapping user journeys</h3>
                <p>This is the first time I got hands on Alexa devices, an Echo Dot (without screen), and an Echo Show
                    (with screen). I documented every step starting from unboxing
                    the devices all the way to finishing my account set up.</p>
                <p>I wanted to document how far a first time user would interact with the device, and how much context
                    can Alexa understand from me naturally speaking to it. Without given any information from the team,
                    I tried different utterance to ask for different pieces of content.</p>

                <h3>Disappointing AI assistant</h3>
                <p>After testing the devices, it is clear to me that Rayo skill (or any other custom skill) were built
                    with a binary approach, similar to a customer service chatbot. You have follow the exact command
                    structure in order for Alexa to understand and perform the action.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Learning the utterance structure</h3>
                <p>There are 2 types of basic (but absolute) structure command that you must follow word by word in
                    order to initate a skill to achieve your goal:</p>

                    existing intents we have inside to serve as a single source of truth.</p>
                <p>They were built very close to the actual Alexa skill taking into account different conditions,
                    synonyms, error feedback. They were also used as prototypes for user testing.</p>

                    source of truth.</p>
                <p>All designs were built with the limitations of the platform, I worked with the principle developer to
                    find the best layout possible for each tasks.</p>

                <h3>Account linking improvements</h3>
                <p>There are too many account linking methods, our support page alone has six separate articles
                    explaining them. This creates high maintenance overhead for developers, when in reality, we only
                    need one reliable solution.</p>
                <p>Out of all the methods, link via the Alexa app is the only one that's bug free. I designed all the
                    journeys, no matter where the start point is, from iOS or Android, from Legacy brand apps or the new
                    Rayo app, from scanning QR code or initiate account link with Alexa, they all deeplinks you to the
                    Alexa app to complete the account linking journey.</p>

                    play content they've previously started, Alexa now prompts them to resume from where they left off.
                </p>
                <p>In the next phase, we plan to introduce a smarter, more personalized experience where Alexa
                    proactively asks if you'd like to continue listening to unfinished contentâ€”either when you launch
                    the Rayo skill or arrive home.</p>
