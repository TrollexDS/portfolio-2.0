                        applies directly onto designs.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As someone who is always looking for ways to streamline or automate processes, I initiated this
                    project with an aim to help my team speed up the UI design tasks, such as explorations, creating
                    user testing mockups, building production ready designs.</p>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>It requires too much effort from the design team to build and maintain a large library of assets
                        in Figma for many different brands from multiple regions that change overtime.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-intro overview">
                    <h4>Goal</h4>
                    <p>To build a Figma plugin that can provide live assets from all of the brands from all of the
                        regions we serve.</p>

                <h3>Why</h3>
                <p>Besides speeding up the making of our production designs, there is another major reason why we want
                    to build our designs as accurate as possible.</p>
                <p>We test our designs with some of our loyal listeners who are very passionate about their favourite
                    stations. Despite our disclaimer about the prototype was only put together for testing specific
                    features, not everything works and might not reflect the actual application. They always notice
                    abnormality and would point out things such as, “this show is not suppose to be here”. We now build
                    accurate designs to avoid these kinds of feedback that could waste valuable testing time.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>POC</h3>
                <p>I began with running a local server pulling images from a folder with thumbnail images. The plugin
                    doesn’t even have UI. When initialed, it updates all the layers that matched the required layer
                    names within the selected frame(s).</p>
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>I took a lot of inspiration from Music Data. It is a plugin that allows users to search for songs and
                    update designs with album artworks, title, artists etc.</p>
                <p>Since not everyone is familiar with all of the station names, I instead build a dropdown to list out
                    stations for my team to choose from.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid">

            </div>
            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Setting up the logic</h3>
                <p>I defined requirements for the plugin to identify the correct layers to update. E.g.
                    A shape layer with the name show-thumbnail, the fill will be replaced with the selected radio show
                    thumbnail image.
                    A text layer with the name show-name, the text string will be replaced with the title of the radio
                    show.
                    I added more as I build more functions into the plugin, but the naming principles are the same.</p>
                <p>I built a notification prompt to appear when none of the selected layers matched the requirements, it
                    lists out the layer names required.</p>
                <p>I also wrote a documentation in Confluence to explain how the codes were structured, and instructions
                    on layer names and how it works.</p>

                <h3>Connecting to the API</h3>
                <p>With my limited coding skill, I reached out to a full stack developer I worked closely for
                    assistance. He helped me with the CORS issues, and provided the appropriate API to be used to
                    fetch stations and shows.</p>

                <h3>Adding podcasts</h3>
                <p>My teammates were working on the Podcast V2 designs, and was thinking it would be nice to have
                    podcasts available in the plugin.</p>
                <p>When I was adding podcasts, knowing that the Rayo app can filter podcasts by genres, meaning we have
                    to mockup designs that display podcasts from a specific genre. To make our lives easier, I also
                    build a genre filter in the plugin.</p>

                <h3>Other regions</h3>
                <p>Rayo is going be available for 8 regions outside the UK: Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,
                    Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway. Each have slightly different configurations based on the UK
                    Rayo app.</p>
                <p>I was tasked with designing the For You page (personalised homepage). To make my life easier, I want
                    the plugin to be able to provide assets from other regions as well. I got the API for other regions
                    by reaching out to the iOS dev who was building the POC of the Rayo app for other regions.</p>
                <p>Due to the fact that APIs from some of the regions are not ready, I decided to hard coded the
                    available ones in, and add more when the others are ready.</p>

                <h3>Episode data</h3>
                <p>Since the beginning of the project, I always wanted to make episode level data available because
                    there are quite a few components that display episode metadata. I just didn’t know how to build it
                    in. However, as I got more familiar with the structure of the APIs, I was more confident to build
                    logic to fetch assets and data from multiple APIs to make it work.</p>

                <h3>Always evolving</h3>
                <p>I am always thinking how to help the team and to make our work easier. The next step is to find a way
                    to populate the whole page with metadata based on requirements with a click of a button. Stay tune
                    for more.</p>
